<!-- # Description

This repository contains the machine learning methods and pipeline for classifying narcolepsy using polysomnography biomarkers that was developed at Stanford University, and is intended primarily for research and historical reference.

Those interested in using the sleep staging classification methods that were developed from this should use the primary, [Stanford-STAGES](https://www.github.com/stanford-stages/stanford-stages) repository. -->
